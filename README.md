# LM2596-4V5-40V-Input-and-5V-3V3-Output

This project features the design of a 5V buck converter using the LM2596S step-down regulator in SMD format. The converter is designed to efficiently step down input voltages (up to 35V) to a regulated 5V output. This module is ideal for powering microcontrollers, sensors, or other 5V systems from higher voltage sources.
Key Features:
